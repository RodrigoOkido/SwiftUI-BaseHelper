# SwiftUI-BaseHelper
Personal SwiftUI project which aims to help and demonstrate many basic concepts of Swift using the brand new declarative framework developed by Apple.

This project was developed based on **Xcode 14.0.1 and Swift 5** (using some Swift 5.7 syntax). So you can find here contents which are only available 
on iOS 16 like Swift Charts for example. 

Here you can find:
- SwiftUI 
  - Stacks (VStack / HStack / ZStack)
  - Texts (Labels)
  - TextField
  - Buttons and Actions
  - Pickers
  - Toggle
  - NavigationView & NavigationLink
- SwiftUI Charts
- SwiftUI ViewModifiers
- API Requests using [MovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) (async / await)
- MapKit & Core Location

Requirements to run properly:
- Xcode 14
- iOS 16

## What is SwiftUI?
SwiftUI is Apple's brand new framework for building user interfaces for iOS, tvOS, macOS, and watchOS. Apple introduced SwiftUI in 2019 and the 
framework has been evolving at a rapid pace ever since. Unlike UIKit and AppKit, SwiftUI is a cross-platform framework.
